# Student_register

We will write a program called student_register.py that allows students
to register for an exam venue.

First, ask the user how many students are registering.

Create a for loop that runs for that amount of students

Each loop asks for the student to enter their ID number.

Write each of the ID numbers to a Text File called reg_form.txt

This will be used as an attendance register that they will sign when they
arrive at the exam venue.
